## INTRODUCTION

This software is designed for the construction of sphere-tree representations
of polygonal models for use in interruptible collision detection algorithms.
The software contains various algorithms for performing these constructions. As
well as our own algorithms we have included our implementations of the OCTREE
algorithm and HUBBARD's medial axis based algorithm.  Detailed descriptions of
all the algorithms contained in this software can be found in the following

## ALGORITHMS

The software implements the following algorithms:

### Octree
 The Octree algorithm is the simplest and fastest algorithm for the
 construction of sphere-trees. The first step of the algorithm is to
 construct a bounding cube that surrounds the object. This cube is then
 divided into 8 sub-cubes by splitting it along the X, Y and Z axes. The
 sub-cubes that are contained within the object are further sub-divided to
 create a set of children nodes. This sub-division can continue to an
 arbitrary depth. The nodes of the octree are finally used to construct a
 sphere-tree by creating a sphere that contains each of the "solid" nodes,
 i.e. nodes that represent part of the object. Our implementation of this
 algorithm is capable of creating either a shell of the object or a solid
 representation. When constructing a solid object the algorithm doesn't need
 to sub-divide any nodes that are completely contained within the object as
 areas inside the object don't need to be refined.


### Grid
 This algorithm is an extension to the Octree algorithm. Each set of
 children spheres is created by sub-dividing the parent node but the grid
 algorithm allows more freedom in the sub-division. Where the octree
 algorithm only ever produced a 2*2*2 division, the Grid algorithm can
 produce a grid of spheres with ANY dimensions as long as the number of
 spheres produced is within the specified maximum. The algorithm also
 optimises the orientation of the grid of spheres, and their size, so as to
 minimise the error in the approximation and to minimise the volume of each
 of the resulting regions.


### Hubbard
 Hubbard uses an approximation of the object's medial axis to construct
 sphere-trees. The medial axis is approximated using a set of spheres which
 are then used to construct the sphere-tree. This algorithm often produces
 tight fitting sphere-trees, certainly tighter than the Octree algorithm.


### Merge
 The merge algorithm is similar to the algorithm used by Hubbard. The set of
 spheres approximating the medial-axis is reduced down to the number
 required for the sphere-tree by successively merging pairs of spheres
 together. The merge algorithm uses the adaptive medial axis approximation
 algorithm to generate the initial set of spheres. It also considers the
 effects of merging pairs of spheres together that will actually improve
 regions of the approximation.


### Burst
 The burst algorithm is another medial axis based algorithm. It aims to
 improve upon the merge algorithm by better distributing the error across
 the resulting set of spheres. The algorithm iteratively reduces the set of
 spheres by bursting (removing) a sphere and using the surrounding sphere to
 fill in the gaps. This algorithm is typically well suited to constructing
 the top levels of sphere-trees but may not perform so well for the lower
 levels.


### Expand
 The expand algorithm takes a different approach to reducing the set of
 medial spheres. In order to reduce the worst error in the approximation,
 the algorithm tries to distribute the error evenly across the entire
 region. This is achieved by growing each of the spheres so that they all
 hang over the surface by the same amount and selecting a sub-set of the
 spheres that will cover the object. A search algorithm is needed to find
 the "stand-off distance" that will result in the desired number of spheres.

### pawn
 The spawn algorithm aims to produce similar results as the expand
 algorithm. Each set of spheres is produced by creating a set of spheres
 that hang over the surface by the same amount, thus distributing the error
 evenly across the approximation. Instead of using the object's medial axis
 for the construction, a local optimisation algorithm is used to generate
 the set of spheres. For each sphere in the set, the optimisation algorithm
 chooses the location that covers the most object, hence keeping the set of
 spheres small. A search algorithm is again used to find the "stand-off"
 distance that yields the required number of spheres.


### Combined
 The combined algorithm allows a number of different algorithms to be used
 in conjunction. For each set of spheres, the algorithm tries a number of
 the other algorithms and chooses the one that results in the lowest error.
 Any of the sphere reduction algorithms can be used in this algorithm, i.e.
 Grid, Merge, Burst, Expand and Spawn, however we typically only use Merge
 and Expand as these are usually produce the tightest approximations.

## PROGRAMS

There are a number of different programs in this distribution.  There is a
Windows GUI based program that allows models to be viewed and sphere-trees to
be constructed using the various algorithms.  It also allows experimentation
with the medial axis approximation algorithms, which are used by many of the
sphere-tree construction algorithms.  The distribution also contains a number
of command line programs.  These implement the algorithms in the same way as
the GUI but allow for batch processing should you want to construct numerous
sphere-trees. The command line programs should also compile on any UNIX like
operating system that supports the use of "configure" scripts.  See below for
instructions on how to build the programs. The following command line programs
are available:

## FILE FORMATS

All the sphere-tree construction programs are capable of loading both OBJ
files and our own special format (`.SUR`).  When we load the models we need to
generate the neighbourhood information for the triangles, the SUR file stores
this so that we don't need to compute it every time.  The GUI program is able
to export OBJ files as SUR.  The format of the SUR file is as follows:

- The number of vertices
- List of vertices with XYZ for position and XYZ for normal
- The number of triangles
- List of triangles with `i0`, `i1`, `i2` (indices of the vertices - zero base)
  `n0`, `n1`, `n2` (neighbouring triangles, `n0` shares edge from `i0` to `i1` etc.)

In order for the program to work properly, the models have the following
restrictions :  The model must be a completely closed surface free from self
intersections.  The -verify option can check if your model is valid.

The programs output the sphere-trees as an SPH file.  This is our own file
format and stores the sphere tree as a flat array.  If the branching factor of
the tree is `B` then the first child of node N will be located at `N*B+1`.  Similarly
the parent node `N` can be computed from the child number `C` as `(C-1)/B`.  The SPH
files are layed out as follows:

- Number of levels in the sphere-tree including root node
- Branching factor of the sphere-tree
- List of spheres as a flat array, XYZ for center and radius (-ve means sphere
is unused), the importance of the sphere (allspheres presently have an importance of 1.)

## BUILDING THE PROGRAMS

Unfortunately due to licensing issues we are unable to distribute all the files
that are used to build the program.  Some of the algorithms use other peoples
code which is distributed with the program.  However, the numerical recipes
code is not allowed to be redistributed and so you have to find the following
files yourself.  An althernative might be to port the NR dependent code to use
freely available code - if you do this i would be most interested in finding out.
The following files are needed: `complex.c`, `complex.h`, `nrutils.c`, `nrutils.h`, `svd.c`, `svd.h`
(some of these can be downloaded for free from http://www.nr.com/public-domain.html)

The distribution also contains the following sources from other people:

Every effort has been made to ensure that we are not distributing copyrighted
material.  However, if you find that we are distributing something against its
copyright policy please let us know and we will gladly rectify it.

### Windows and MS Visual Studio

The distribution contains workspace files for Microsoft Visual C++ v6.  These
files are located in the `vc/` directory.  The spheretree.dsw contains all the
projects which can used to build the GUI and command line programs.  The GUI
program requires MFC and OpenGL to compile.  The windows code is also capable
of loading Rhino3D files using the RhinoIO API.  Uncomment `#define USE_RHINO_IO`
in surface.h to use this format (you may need to play around with the header and
library locations).  The GUI program also allows you to save images of the models
etc. if you have ImageMagick.  To use this uncomment `#define USE_IMAGE_MAGICK` in
IMsupport.h (you'll definitely need to know what you are doing with the libraries
and headers for this one). The EXE files for the programs will be put in the
build folder under either debug or release.

### Unix-like systems

A CMake build configuration is provided by `yixuanzhou@sjtu.edu.cn`, using the fantastic
[cmake-template](https://github.com/cpp-best-practices/cmake_template/tree/main). 

```console
cmake -B build .
cmake --build build
```

For a debug build, add `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` and `-DENABLE_SANITIZER=ON` to the cmake step above.
The purpose of enabling sanitizers in a project is to detect and debug runtime issues during program execution.
Sanitizers are a set of tools provided by e.g. GCC and Clang and instrument the code to catch memory-related, threading, and other runtime bugs which may not be easily detectable during regular testing. 

When `ENABLE_SANITIZER` is enabled, `address`, `leak`, `undefined_behavior`, `memory` are enabled.
